> **Note:** `arara 3.0` is now available on CTAN and TeX Live! If you want to use the installers, please take a look at the `releases/` directory. Sadly, GitHub got rid of the *Downloads* section, so I had to include the installers as a normal commit.

> **Attention:** we are already testing the upcoming `arara 4.0`!
