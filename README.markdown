Time to shake things up. `:)`

I am already working on a new version of `arara`. According to my numbers, it will be version `6.0` (I might explain *why* in the documentation later on). A lot of new features, improvements and changes are on their way. And also ducks.

Big repository cleanup. If you need access to the old codebase, make sure to take a look in [here](https://github.com/cereda/arara/releases). Sadly, I jave to update things at a slow pace, but hopefully everything will be in place soon. `:)`

Binary releases are now powered by Bintray and not available in here anymore. You can [click here](https://bintray.com/cereda/arara/installers/_latestVersion) or use the button below to get access to the current `3.0` release.
